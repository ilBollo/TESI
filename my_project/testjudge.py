You will be given a question.
Your task is to provide a 'total rating' representing how context-independent this question is.
Give your answer on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 means that the question depends on additional information to be understood, and 5 means that the question makes sense by itself.
For instance, if the question refers to a particular setting, like 'in the context' or 'in the document', the rating must be 1.
The questions can contain obscure technical nouns or acronyms like Gradio, Hub, Hugging Face or Space and still be a 5: it must simply be clear to an operator with access to documentation what the question is about.

For instance, "What is the name of the checkpoint from which the ViT model is imported?" should receive a 1, since there is an implicit mention of a context, thus the question is not independent from the context.
